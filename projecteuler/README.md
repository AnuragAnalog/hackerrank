## Project Euler #1: Multiples of 3 and 5

### Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

### Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9

### Output Format

For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

## Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

### Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ....

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
* 10 ≤ N ≤ 4 x 10^16

### Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

## Project Euler #16: Power digit sum

### Statement

2^9 = 512 and the sum of its digits is 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^N?

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer N.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4

### Output Format

Print the values corresponding to each test case.

## Project Euler #20: Factorial digit sum

### Statement

    n! means n x (n-1) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1
For example, 10! = 10 x 9 x ... x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number N!

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer N.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
* 10 ≤ N ≤ 1000

### Output Format

Print the values corresponding to each test case.

## Project Euler #42: Coded triangle numbers

### Statement

The nth term of a sequence of triangle numbers is given by,

    tn = n(n+1)/2

so the first ten triangle numbers are:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 55, .......

You are given an integer. If it is a triangular number tn, print the term n corresponding to this number, else print -1

### Input Format

First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
* 1s ≤ tn ≤ 10^10

### Output Format

Print the answer corresponding to each test case in a new line.
